# Tic Tac Toe

### Rules of the game
(There will be 3 rounds)
1. player 1 choose your symbol
2. player 2 will go first 
3. take turns placing your symbols in the block 
4. if a player places their symbol 3 in a row, they win

### Technical Challenges
- having fully functional javascript

### Wireframe

- if no one gets three in a row they redo the round and each player can place two symbols on their turn (possibly will be able to do)
